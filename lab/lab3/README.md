## AWT GUI
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop Graphical User Interface (GUI) or windows-based applications in Java.

Java AWT components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT is heavy weight i.e. its components are using the resources of underlying operating system (OS).

The java.awt package provides classes for AWT API such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc.
